Actuator: It provides the production ready features for monitoring and managing application.
It expose some endpoints that help you gain insights into your application.

Impl:
Just add actuator dependency starter in pom file.
Now run the application & and you can see in logs saying " Exposing 1 endpoints beneath base path '/actuator'"
which means by default only endpoint is enabled that is "/health"

To access the endpoints : http://localhost:port_number/actuator/health
The above tells whether application is UP or Down.

In Actuator, we have total 14 endpoints
to enable all endpoints use add this property in properties file

management.endpoints.web.exposure.include = *

- To enable only specific endpoints add this
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include= info,health,mappings

- To exclude any endpoint add this
management.endpoints.web.exposure.exclude= info

// Endpoints:
1. http://localhost:port_number/actuator : tells number of endpoints and it links to access.
2. http://localhost:port_number/actuator/health : it tells about whether application is up or down
3. http://localhost:port_number/actuator/info : display custom application info.
4. http://localhost:port_number/actuator/metrics : by using this we can monitor the metrics
5. http://localhost:port_number/actuator/beans : it tells scope and dependencies of each bean
6. http://localhost:port_number/actuator/env : It tells about env that we configured in application properties
7. http://localhost:port_number/actuator/configprops : Displays all configs props bound to spring boot.
8. http://localhost:port_number/actuator/mappings : It gives info about endpoints we written
9. http://localhost:port_number/actuator/threaddump: provides info about thread dump of jvm
10.http://localhost:port_number/actuator/loggers : Allows viewing application level logs.
13.http://localhost:port_number/actuator/heapdump: It generated and downloads the heap dump file useful for memory analysis.
14.http://localhost:port_number/actuator/shutdown: it used to stop the running application.


All other endpoints are accessed by Using GET access but shutdown endpoint is accessed by using POST request.
for security reasons it is disabled.
to enable this endpoint use this.
management.endpoint.shutdown.enabled = true
